# OLED SSD1306 128x64 pixels monochrome.

### Functional examples with a 128X64 pixel OLED are added in this section. It is powered at 3.3V (there are also 5V) and until now the information is sent to it through an I2C bus.

There are several sizes of screens and in each of them the final numbering of the chip varies. For example, 0.96'' screens have the SSD1306 chip. I don't know if changing the screen to a bigger one can change the I2C address. I have two sizes and they both use the same I2C address.

If the I2C address changes you, **[click here](https://groups.google.com/g/fpga-wars-explorando-el-lado-libre)** for help and I'll send you the circuit with that change.
